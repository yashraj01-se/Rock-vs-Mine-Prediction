# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

# Rock vs Mine Prediction Project

## Overview
The Rock vs Mine Prediction project is an AI/ML solution designed to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on input data. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the nature of the object, providing a robust tool for geological or defense-related applications.

## Features
- **Classification**: Predicts whether the object is a rock or a mine.
- **Data Processing**: Handles noisy and complex datasets effectively.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale datasets.
- **Interpretability**: Provides insights into model performance and predictions.

## Dataset
The project is based on a publicly available dataset, containing samples with various features (e.g., sonar signals) used to differentiate between rocks and mines. Each sample includes multiple numerical attributes and a labeled output.

- **Source**: [Insert Dataset Source]
- **Size**: [Number of Samples and Features]
- **Format**: CSV/Excel/Other

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Normalization/Scaling
   - Splitting into training and testing sets

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Feature selection
   - Dimensionality reduction (if applicable)

3. **Model Training**:
   - Algorithms used: [e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks]
   - Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis
